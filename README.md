# Bayesian_estimation_IWWC
This repository contains sample code for the ongoing project: Bayesian estimation of the parameters of Inverse Weibull-Weibull Composite (IWWC) distribution.
The Weibull distribution is frequently used for life data analysis. This distribution is composited with inverse Weibull distribution to obtain computationally convenient parameteric distribuiton for modeling reliability data (Cooray et.al., 2010). In the past, least squares parameter estimation technique is used for this composite distribution. The ongoing work employs Bayesian method with both non-informative Jeffrey's prior and a weakly informative Gamma prior for parameter estimation. A repair time reliability data is analyzed to study the peformance of developed method.
